Gamepad Conventions:

Gamepad1:
Left stick: for driving forwards and strafing
Right stick: for turning
    If both sticks are being used at the same time, then both will be taken into account
Dead zone: .13 (x and y, left and right stick)
Left/Right Shoulders: for moving lift up and down (left = down, right = up)

Gamepad2 (currently all on Gamepad1):
DPad:
    Up/Down: For moving slides (pulley) up and down
    Right/Left triggers: For moving hands in and out (left = out, right = in)
